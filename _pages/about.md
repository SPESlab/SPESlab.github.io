I am an Associate Professor in the College of Information and Electrical Engineering at China Agricultural University. My research integrates instrumentation, environmental physics, and sensing technologies to better characterize and manage complex soil-plant-atmosphere interactions.

Research Interests
------
-	Instrumentation for characterization of soil properties and processes, including soil-water content, -water potential, -electric conductivity, -compaction, -bulk density, -thermal properties, -water flux, -heat flux, -greenhouse gas emission, and -evapotranspiration.
-	Dielectric measurement; time domain reflectometry; frequency domain measurement; dielectric spectroscopy; electromagnetic simulation.
-	Soil thermal measurement; heat pulse probe; thermo-TDR; thermo-FDR; heat transfer model.
-	Three-dimensional, multispectral, and thermal measurements for plant status monitoring.
